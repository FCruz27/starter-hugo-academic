title: Word and Face Processing
summary: My research interest here lies in the underlying mechanisms - such as holistic processing of visual stimuli - enabling fast and accurate identification of frequently-exposed-to objects, namely words and faces. Moreover, I also explore the how's and why's behind the cross-race effect - the tendency for people to more accurately recall faces belonging to their ethnicity (vs. faces from other ethnicities).
