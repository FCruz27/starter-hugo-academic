As society grows more complex, individuals are prompted to acquire expertise on narrower domains. It follows that experts are more knowledgeable in their domain of expertise than non-experts. However, we often see people (e.g., on TV) providing insights on domains beyond the scope of their expertise - a phenomenon coined epistemic trespassing. The "experts" that provided commentary on disease contagion throughout the pandemic are the ones who then opinated about military strategy in the wake of the war in Ukraine. In this line of research, we explore whether people trust epistemic trespassers and the characteristics that might make them appear more trustworthy. Simultaneously, we try to shed light on the conditions under which trespassers feel entitled to trespass.
