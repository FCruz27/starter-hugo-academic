title: Epistemic Trespassing
summary: This line of research focuses on epistemic trespassers - people that give advice and/or opinions about domains beyond those they are experts on. We study this by focusing on the trespassers themselves (e.g., when do they feel entitled to trespass), as well as on the audience (e.g., to what extent do they trust the trespassers' advice/opinions).
