As society grows more complex, individuals are prompted to acquire expertise on narrower domains. It follows that experts are more knowledgeable in their domain of expertise than non-experts. However, we often see people (e.g., on TV) providing insights on domains beyond the scope of their expertise - a phenomenon coined epistemic trespassing. The "experts" that provided commentary on epidemics throughout the pandemic are the ones who then talked about military strategy in the wake of the war in Ukraine. In this line of research, we explore epistemic trespassers from both the perspective of the trespassers (i.e., the conditions under which one feels entitled to trespass) and of the receivers (i.e., whether people trust epistemic trespassers and why).
